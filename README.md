# Those are two different parts that I'm working on. The website.zip contains a basic index.html page which can contain different tabs at 
# the top for an admin user to view different customer's graphs. The login-system1.zip contains a login/registration page index.php which 
# handles logging in and registering. Neither are finished but they are some things. I might not use that login system, but I'm tinkering 
# around with it trying to figure out how to make it work, it didn't work even though it was claimed to be working by a tutorial on it.
